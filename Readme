The code implemented a toy of lightweight recoverable virtual memory.

1. build the lrvm library:
   $make
   the liblrvm.a library will be generated under lib directory 

2. compile the test program
	$make test

	the testing program will be generated under bin directory

3. run the test program
	cd bin
	./abort (or other program)

4. for truncate:
   as the implementation automatically trunclates the log with 
   an successful commitment, we generated a log in tests for demo.
   firsty copy the log file to rvm directory, e.g rvm_segments 
   (clear all files inside it to minmal the stat of crash firstly),
   and then run the truncate program.
